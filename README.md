Introduction
============

A slide show is a familiar and simple sort of "memex" showing a trail of
images.  Project-1 is a web-based tool for finding images related to search
terms, using those images to create slide shows, and then viewing those slide
shows.

This is my first commit to the README.md file. We have also added Andrew and 
Gilbert to the collaborators list.
